# 0.1.0
- A rudimentary prototype
- Uses MSU to register a (red) screen that is currently fixed to the bottom left corner of the screen
- Screen is visible by default (seems to be default MSU UI behaviour)
- Simple functions in `cds_screen.nut` to show/hide the screen and make text appear on the screen.
